Extends WooCommerce providing the Basic version of the GestPay (Banca Sella) redirect gateway for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Extends WooCommerce providing the Basic version of the GestPay (Banca Sella) redirect gateway for WooCommerce.

**This plugin only works with the BASIC version of the GestPay service.**

= ADVANCED VERSION NOTES =

*The ADVANCED version will also allow to directly insert the card informations (such as: number, verify code, date, email and so on) and for this reason, errors must be checked and handled here. ATM I can only make tests on the BASIC account version in which all the card checks are made in the GestPay page self: if an error occurs, there is no problem in this plugin because before return something, all values must be verified by the GestPay gateway it self. So, from the GestPay page to the view-order page, will be always a good response (a part of server/webservice error that are handled).*

If you need also the ADVANCED version send me an email at **info@mauromascia.com**
